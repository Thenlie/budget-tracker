# Budget Tracker PWA ![Project License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

  I updated an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total is updated when they're brought back online.

  ## Deployed with Heroku at:
